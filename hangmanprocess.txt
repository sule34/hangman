OBJECTIVE:
This program will allow the user to play Hangman against the computer using a list of words from a txt file
A function that randomly selects a word from the text dictionary
A fuction that takes input from the user which will be each letter guessed
A function that will take the letters guessed correctly and turn them into a string
We need to create the various variables to store the users inputted data
We need a variable for the word the computer picks
We need to create a set of data that holds the letters guessed wrong and the letters guessed right by the user
We need to display an intro to the program
We need to build a repetitive system, so that the user can keep guessing letters.
If the player guesses wrong, a new part of the body is drawn, unit they lose.
We will add statements at the end and the beginning that welcome and thank the user for playing.
